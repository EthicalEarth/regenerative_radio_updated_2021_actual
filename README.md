# regenerative_radio_updated_2021
A new hight-sensitive regenerative radio receiver with electronical control (varicap).

Radio is receiving signals in the range of 20-40 meters. 
The frequency range depends on the specifically installed components that were measured during operation. The coil was used with 30-40 turns on a diameter of 20 mm, and a varicap is being used with 20...500 pF capacity.

The sound and receiving quality was increaced, and better than first project https://github.com/EthicalEarth/superregenerative_radio_2019_actual

ONLY AM Mode, SSB wasn't tested
